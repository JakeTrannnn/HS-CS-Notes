Changing? 4 alternatives
When implementing/installing a new system or piece of
software, there are 4 alternatives of doing it:
• Direct changeover
• Parallel running
• Pilot running
• Phased conversion

Direct changeover
Old system is stopped and new system is started.
Advantages: minimal time and effort, new system is available immediately
Disadvantage: if the new system fails, there is no fall back

Parallel running
The new system is started, but the old system is kept running
alongside it. Data has to entered into both systems.
Advantages: if the new system fails, the old systems runs a backup (no loss
of productivity); outputs from the two systems can be compared to see if
new one is running correctly
Disadvantage: running two systems is costly in terms of time and money

Pilot running
The new system is piloted (tested) with a small subset of the
organisation. Once it is running correctly and all bugs have been
ironed out, it is implemented across the whole organisation.
Advantages: all features are fully trialled; if the new system fails, only a small part of
the organisation suffers; staff who were part of the pilot can train other staff
Disadvantage: for the subset of users in the pilot group, there is no backup if the
new system fails

Phased conversion
The new system is introduced in phases as parts of the old
system are gradually replaced with the new system
Advantages: allows people to get used to the new system; training of staff
can be done in stages
Disadvantage: if the new system fails, there is no fall back for that part of
the system
