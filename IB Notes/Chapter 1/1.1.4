Compare the implementation of
systems using a client’s hardware with
hosting systems remotely

Local software vs Remote software
• There are two competing models of distributing software:
Local and Remote (also called SaaS/cloud).
• You can either buy a program and install it on a particular
computer or set of computers (called local)
• Or you can buy/rent/use software that is installed on a
computer somewhere on the internet and then use it though
a browser or dedicated local application (called remote)

SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SaaS is a software distribution model in which a third-party
provider hosts applications and makes them available to
customers over the Internet.

Benefits of being ‘cloud-based’
• SaaS is great for any organisation that wants to minimize it’s IT
responsibilities and costs.
• SaaS is particularly well suited for small businesses. Instead of
investing in additional in-house server capacity and software
licenses, companies simply can adjust their SaaS subscription on a
monthly basis, 

Drawbacks of SaaS
• Companies that adopt multiple SaaS applications or plan to
connect hosted software with existing on-premise apps may
encounter software integration headaches along the way.
• Security is another common concern: whenever sensitive
company data and business processes are entrusted to a
third-party service provider, issues such as identity and
access management must be addressed.
