Suggest various types of testing

Testing is important!
• Testing is very important in developing a computerized
system as it tries to ensure that the system works as
expected.
• A system that does not work as expected (i.e. it has bugs)
greatly reduces productivity and end user satisfaction. 

Static vs Dynamic testing
• Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, 
whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases
is referred to as dynamic testing.


Black-box vs White-box testing
• Black-box testing (also known as functional testing) treats
software under test as a black-box without knowing its
internals. Tests are using software interfaces and trying to
ensure that they work as expected.
• White-box testing (also known as structural testing) looks
inside the software that is being tested and uses that
knowledge as part of the testing process.

User acceptance testing
• Testing any new/updated system with its ultimate end users
to see if it meets their expectation is very important.
• Happy users = more productive users = good for developers

Automated testing
• Automated testing is a method in software testing that
makes use of special software tools to control the execution
of tests and then compares actual test results with predicted
or expected results.
