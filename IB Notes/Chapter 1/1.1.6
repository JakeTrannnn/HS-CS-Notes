Discuss problems that may arise as a
part of data migration

Data migration = moving data
• Data migration can be as simple as putting a file on a USB flash drive and opening it on another computer.
• It is can also be very complex involving big databases exchanging information across countries into different time zones.

Possible problems that may arise
• Incompatible file formats
• Data structure differences
• Validation rules
• Incomplete data transfers
• International conventions on dates,currencies & character sets

Incompatible file formats
• As the same piece of software might have different versions, the data created in one version, might not be compatible with another version

Data structure differences
• Moving data from a table to a flat file, or from an array to a linked list, might cause a lot of problems.

Validation rules
• These rules are applied to inputs. If these are different at the destination than at the source, data will be rejected and lost. 

Incomplete data transfers
• If the actual transfer is interrupted, only part of the data will be at the destination, leading to loss. 

Differences in data/currency/character set
• The $ might mean US dollars, but could be taken to mean Zimbabwe dollars which use the same symbol but is worth significantly less.
