Identify different types of networks

Types of Networks
• LAN
• WAN
• VLAN
• SAN
• WLAN
• Internet
• Extranet
• VPN
• PAN
• P2P

Definition: Network
• A computer network is a group of computer systems and
other computing hardware devices that are linked together

LAN = Local Area Network
• LAN stands for local area network. It covers, as the name
suggests, a local area.

WAN = Wide Area Network
• The name is exactly what it sounds like: a network that
covers an area wider than a LAN. 

VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network
• A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical group of
workstations, servers and network devices that appear to
be on the same LAN despite their geographical
distribution.

SAN = Storage Area Network
• A storage area network (SAN) is a secure high-speed data
transfer network that provides access to consolidated blocklevel storage

WLAN = Wireless Local Area Network
• A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a wireless
distribution method for two or more devices that use highfrequency radio waves and often include an access point to
the Internet. 

Internet = network of networks
• The internet is a globally connected network system that uses the
TCP/IP protocols to transmit data via various types of media

Extranet
• An extranet is a controlled private network allowing
customers, partners, vendors, suppliers and other
businesses to gain information, typically about a specific
company or educational institution, and do so without
granting access to the organization's entire network

VPN = Virtual Private Network
• It uses the internet to allow people to log into a network
remotely and access its resources, but encrypts the connection
to thwart eavesdroppers

PAN = Personal Area Network
• It's exactly what it sounds like: a network covering a very
small area, usually a small room

P2P = Peer-to-Peer
• Peer-to-peer is a network model in which
computers or hardware devices exchange files
