Explain why the speed of data transmission across a network can vary

Connection speed averages
• Dedicated LAN connections
    UTP Copper cable 
    Fibre optic cable 
    WiFi 
• Broadband (WAN) connections
    DSL
    Fibre optic
    3G
    4G
Primary concept: Traffic
• The primary concept is that speeds vary due to traffic

Tertiary causes of speed variance
• Environmental issues
