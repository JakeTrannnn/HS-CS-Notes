Explain the machine instruction cycle

The Fetch-Execute cycle
The basic operation of a computer is called the ‘fetch-execute’
cycle

Step 1: Fetching the instruction
The first step the fetch-execute cycle carries out is fetching the
instruction

Step 2: Decoding the instruction
Once the instruction has been fetched, the CPU will need to
understand the instruction to action it

Step 3: Executing the instruction
When the instruction has been decoded, the CPU can carry out
the action that is needed
