Describe primary memory

Primary memory = RAM
As RAM is so important, it is often referred to as primary
memory (even though it is actually only a branch of primary
memory, alongside the cache and ROM)

RAM = Random Access Memory
Contains the data and instructions the
computer has loaded since starting up and
everything the user has opened/loaded

ROM = Read Only Memory
Non-volatile = does not lose its contents if power is lost
