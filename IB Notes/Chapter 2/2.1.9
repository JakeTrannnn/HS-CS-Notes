Define the terms: bit, byte, binary,
denary/decimal and hexadecimal

Definition: bit
Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store
data. A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data
in computing

Definition: byte
Bits can be grouped together to make them easier to
work with. A group of 8 bits is called a byte

Definition: binary
• Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data.
• Because it only has 2 symbols (0 & 1) it is also called BASE-2
numbering

Definition: denary / decimal
Denary is a numbering system with 10 symbols: 0123456789
It is, therefore, often referred to as BASE-10 numbering.

Definition: hexadecimal
• Hexadecimal is a numbering system with 16 symbols
