CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The key component of a computer system,
which contains the circuitry necessary to fetch,
decode and execute program instructions from
and to main memory (RAM).

Two functions of the CU
It handles the loading of new commands into
the CPU and the decoding of these commands. 

CPU needs it’s own ‘memory’
Registers: they are small, very fast circuits that store
intermediate values from calculations or
instructions inside the CPU.

MAR (Memory Address Register)
• MAR is connected to the address bus.
