Define the Boolean operators: AND,
OR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XOR

What is logic?
• Its how a machine will solve problems.
• Machines (at basic level) do not understand
semantics like humans – no grey areas.

Possible real-world applications
AND Fire alarm: Smoke (1) AND heat (1)
OR Internal car light: Either door open (1)
NOT Microwave will stop (0) if the door is open (1). Vice versa….
NAND Security system is engaged up until both the correct code and ID
are scanned, then it disengages.
NOR Air conditioning: AC will only come on (1) if BOTH windows A and
B are closed. (0)
XOR 2 light switches in one corridor
