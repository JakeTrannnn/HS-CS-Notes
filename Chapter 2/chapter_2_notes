Java.lang.String

Constructors
    Named the same as the class

Strings are immutable
Overloaded - Same name, different arguments
Any new instances of an object use the keyword new and call the class Constructor
Heap - where objects are stored
Object variables are just pointers that point to the object

Rectangle bob = new Rectangle(200, 100, 17, 5);
Rectangle george = new Rectangle(500, 500);
System.out.println(bob);
System.out.println(george);
Rectangle bob2 = bob;
System.out.println(bob2);
bob2.setSize(100, 100);
System.out.println(bob2);
System.out.println(bob);

Rectangle george2 = new Rectangle(100, 100);

Java.Lang does not need any import statements
